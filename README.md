# Hand Tracking and Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking and detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The program captures live video input from a webcam, detects hands in the video stream, and tracks the hand landmarks. Additionally, it computes and displays the frames per second (FPS).

## Features

- Detects hands in real-time using the webcam.
- Tracks 21 hand landmarks per detected hand.
- Displays hand landmarks and connections on the video feed.
- Shows the FPS for performance monitoring.

## Requirements

Before running the program, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
